# Scientific-Calc-avr
Scientific calc project using Atmega328p

This project is running such possible as I can. (discontinued project)
The ideas to implement:
* Basic scientific executions
* Lagrange Interpolation
* Store data into external SD card
* RPN mode
* Equations solver
* Plot graphics into .txt file in SD card
