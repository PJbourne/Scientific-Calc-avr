# Scientific-Calc-avr (discontinued project)
Scientific calculator project using Atmega328p

This project is running such possible as I can. 
The ideas to implement:
* Keyboard (implemented)
* Reverse Polonese Notation mode (implemented)
* Basic scientific calculations (implemented)
* Lagrange Interpolation (under implementation)
* Store on send data to external device (under implementation)
* Equations expression solver (maybe will not be possible)
* Plot graphics into .txt file in SD card (possible but little hard to implement)
