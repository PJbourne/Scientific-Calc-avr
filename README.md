# Scientific-Calculator
Scientific calculator project using Atmega328p

This project is running such possible as I can. 
The ideas to implement:
* Keyboard (implemented)
* Reverse Polonese Notation mode (implemented)
* Basic scientific calculations (implemented)
* Lagrange Interpolation (under implementation)
* Store on send data to external device (under implementation)
* Equations expression solver (maybe will not be possible)
* Plot graphics into .txt file in SD card (possible but little hard to implement)

Now the project is at the 4th attempt, and up to achieve new possibilities.

At this 4th model, version 1.2.1, it's possible to use a 31 buttons kayboard without loss of IOs. There are yet four IOs up to be used for other porpuses [digital 0 (Rx), 1 (Tx), 2, 3, 4, and 13 (Sck)] .
