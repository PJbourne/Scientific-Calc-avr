# Scientific-Calc-avr
Scientific calc (RPN &amp; EQN) project using Atmega328p

I did stop this project. I started a new, trying to improve tactil buttons reading and precision.
Atmega328p doesn't work with 8 bytes for doubles. So to next project the idea is to try improve a system that increase precision in calculus execution and result, and store the calculos or any event in a sdcard.
